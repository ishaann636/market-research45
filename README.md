**Key Strategic Pillars:**

**Vertical Integration:** Bitdeer is actively pursuing full vertical integration to gain control over costs, enhance energy efficiency, and improve supply chain management. This includes developing its own power generation assets, such as the recently announced acquisition of a 101 MW site and gas-fired power project in Alberta, Canada, expected to be energized by Q4 2026. This project aims to be a net-zero carbon producer through a carbon utilization system.

**Proprietary ASIC Technology**: A central element of Bitdeer's strategy is the development of its own advanced ASIC technology. The company is actively engaged in R&D, with its SEALMINER series progressing through various stages.

**oSEALMINER A1:** Mass production completed with approximately 3.8 EH/s of mining rigs manufactured.

**oSEALMINER A2:** Includes air-cooled (SEALMINER A2 Pro Air) and hydro-cooled (SEALMINER A2 Pro Hyd) models with enhanced power efficiency.

**oSEALMINER A3 & A4:** Under development with significant improvements in energy efficiency targeted.

**Global Diversification of Data Centers:** Bitdeer strategically locates its data centers in regions with access to cost-effective and clean energy sources. Norway, with its abundance of hydropower, plays a crucial role in this strategy.

**Expansion into HPC/AI:** Recognizing the growing demand for high-performance computing, Bitdeer is expanding its infrastructure to support AI applications. The company has engaged Northland Capital Markets as a financial advisor for its HPC/AI data center development strategy and has GB200 NVL72 reservations open for deployment in 2025.

**Sustainability:** Bitdeer emphasizes the use of renewable energy sources, particularly hydropower in its Norway and Bhutan facilities, to reduce its carbon footprint and ensure stable energy costs. The company is also exploring advanced cooling solutions and carbon offset programs.

**Recent Developments:**

**March 2025 Production and Operations Update:** Bitdeer reported a self-mined Bitcoin production of 114 BTC. The deployment of SEALMINER A1 and A2 rigs is ongoing, increasing the self-mining hashrate. Progress in the development of the Tydal, Norway data center expansion continues, with energization expected by mid-2025.

**January 2025 Update:** Indicated ongoing expansion of the Tydal, Norway site to 175 MW, with phase 1 (40 MW) awaiting regulatory approval.

**Acquisition in Alberta (February 2025):** Strategic acquisition of a 101 MW site and gas-fired power project to establish a fully vertically integrated Bitcoin mining operation.

**Norway Data Center Market: Strategy, Emerging Innovations, and Developments**

The Norway data center market is experiencing substantial growth, driven by factors such as increasing cloud adoption, the rise of big data and IoT, and the country's strong focus on sustainability and renewable energy.

**Key Strategies:**

**Leveraging Renewable Energy:** Norway's data center market strategy heavily emphasizes its abundant and affordable hydropower resources. This attracts companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and benefit from stable energy costs. The government actively promotes this advantage.

**Government Support and Initiatives:** The Norwegian government has demonstrated a strong commitment to developing the data center industry through national strategies, tax reductions, and incentives to improve connectivity. The updated network infrastructure strategy aims to continually enhance the country's digital infrastructure.

**Excellent Connectivity:** Norway boasts excellent connectivity to European "data highways" and the US through high-speed submarine fiber cables, ensuring low latency for data transmission. Ongoing investments in expanding this network further strengthen its position as a key European digital hub.

**Focus on Sustainability:** Beyond renewable energy, the market is seeing increased adoption of energy-efficient technologies and green data center practices. Operators are implementing advanced liquid cooling, heat recovery systems, and exploring innovative construction materials like timber wood to minimize environmental impact.

**Strategic Locations and Natural Cooling:** Norway's naturally cold climate provides opportunities for efficient free cooling, significantly reducing the need for mechanical cooling and lowering operational costs. Many data centers are strategically located near fjords and other natural cooling sources.

**Emerging Innovations:**

**Advanced Cooling Technologies:** Adoption of liquid cooling systems and immersion cooling to manage the high thermal output of modern computing infrastructure more efficiently.
